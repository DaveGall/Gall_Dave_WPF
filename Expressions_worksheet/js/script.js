var slicesPerPie = 8; //I have assigned a variable for the number of slices per pie.
var partyPeople = 72; //I have now assigned a variable for the number of party goers.
var piesOrdered = 17; //I have assigned a value for the amount of pies ordered for the party.
var sparkyPizza = slicesPerPie * piesOrdered % partyPeople; //I have applied an equation for finding out the amount of pizza Sparky had.

console.log("Sparky got " + (sparkyPizza) + " slices of pizza."); //I added the print function to display the result onto the console.
