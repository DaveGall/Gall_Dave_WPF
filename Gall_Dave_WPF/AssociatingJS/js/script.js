// Conditional logic

var kidHeight = 40;
var minHeight = 48;

//If the child is old enough print to the console you can ride.
//If the kid is over 48 inches in height.
if(kidHeight > minHeight){
    //code performed if condition is true.
    console.log("You can ride the coaster!");
}
if(kidHeight <= minHeight){
    console.log("Sorry kid you got some growing to do!");
}
