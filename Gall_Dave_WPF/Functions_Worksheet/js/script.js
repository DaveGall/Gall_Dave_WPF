    var pie = Math.PI;//The value of pie, researched and retrieved from the W3Schools website.
    var circumference = 2 * pie * radius;//Equation that will determine the circumference of the circle.

//David Gall, 04/25/2014, Stung!!, This is the bee problem on the functions worksheet.
//It takes 8.666666667 stings from bees per pound to kill an animal. For this problem I am going to round to 8.67. We will need the victims weight in pounds and the return will be the number of stings that will end up killing the unfortunate animal.

function animalDeath(animalWeight){//My function parameter.
    var stingsPerPound = 8.67;//Establish a constant for the equation we are creating.
    var numberOfStings = animalWeight * stingsPerPound;//Equation for determining the amount of stings that will kill an animal according to its weight.
    return numberOfStings;//The return value of my equation.
}

var animalWeight = Number(prompt("How many pounds does the animal way?"));//The variable of the weight of the animal which will change so I have used a prompt command to get the information from the user.
alert("It takes "+parseFloat(animalDeath(animalWeight)).toFixed(2)+" bee stings to kill this animal.");
console.log("It takes "+parseFloat(animalDeath(animalWeight)).toFixed(2)+" bee stings to kill this animal.");//This is the printed statement that will print out to the console for viewing.
