/*How many fish can you put in your new aquarium. Going on the usual rule for freshwater fish we would assume that you could have 1 inch of fish per gallon of your tank. That's final size of the fish.
We need to find the volume of the fish tank
Length of tank * width of tank * height of tank = Volume of the tank. All measurements would need to be in inches
That answer divided by 231 ( this is how many cubic inches are in a gallon.
That will give you the number of inches of fish you can have in your tank.
*/
//Setting up my function for the code I am writing.
function fishTank(length, width, height){//These will be my variables that will be run through my function.
    var volume = length * width * height;//Equation for getting the volume of the users tank.
    var gallons = volume / 231;//Equation for determining the amount of gallons in the fish tank.
}
